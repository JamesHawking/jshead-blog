This is Part 2 of a series of articles for programmers looking to upgrade their skills. Part 1 took us through the very beginning stages where we set out to find the most efficient way to go from zero to an employable developer. Today, we are going to take things a whole lot further.
This article is for all the developers, coders, programmers out there who are looking to make a jump in their career after having had a few years in the industry (or you may be just starting out but would like to see the sort of path you have to go on). This article is for those with a simple desire: You want to be considered a Senior Developer and you want to excel in your field. By the end of reading this, you will have a set path with a list of the best resources for you to level up and become a senior developer. Woaa! bold statement. Hope I got you hooked. Let’s dive in.
Disclaimer: As with all things in life, you can always set your own path. Although this is not meant to be the only way, it is a method that I have discovered in my own career, and through many conversations and interviews I have had in the past year with people I consider senior and respected programmers in the community. I have accumulated all of the commonalities into this post. Underneath all of this is not just an article on how to become a better developer. It is a how to guide on optimizing your time with efficient and useful tools so that you get the most out of your life. You can take this sort of learning anywhere in the future.
What Do We Want?
We all strive to be better at our jobs. What the specifics of that statement may be is up to the individual person. However, most people can agree on a few common things:
We don’t want to go through life being seen as ‘incompetent’
We want to be respect by our coworkers
We want to feel smart and accomplished
We want to feel appreciated
In order to achieve the above, we can’t just rest on our laurels, and expect things to come to us. Especially in the world of programming, where the technology is always changing, and the amount of information available to us is overwhelming, we want to focus our attention on growing and learning without burning out. With more and more developers coming out of colleges and bootcamps, we need to keep our skills sharp, and the way to set yourself apart is to be smart and efficient when learning. Enough talk, let’s dive in. As always we will try and take the best approach.
